GLB_PLACEHOLDER_FILE
This file represents a 3D board model that should be:
- 18x18 units (9x9 grid with 2 units per cell)
- Wooden texture with PBR materials
- Flat plane elevated slightly above origin
- UV mapped for texture application

To replace with real glTF:
1. Create/download a wooden board model
2. Export as .glb format from Blender/3ds Max
3. Ensure proper PBR materials (albedo, normal, roughness)
4. Replace this file with the real .glb
